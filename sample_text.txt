Artificial intelligence (AI) is a
wide-ranging branch of computer science
concerned with building smart machines
capable of performing tasks that typically
require human intelligence.
AI is an interdisciplinary science with
multiple approaches, but advancements in
machine learning and deep learning are
creating a paradigm shift in virtually
every sector of the tech industry.
The long-term goal of many researchers is to
create strong AI (also known as AGI, or
Artificial General Intelligence), which
would be a machine that possesses the
 ability to understand or learn any
 intellectual task that a human being can.
